  <h1>Here's how it works.</h1>
  <p>${brandName} is the named discipline. The website exists to explain the machine, not to decorate it.</p>
  <p><strong>The math is simple.</strong> Premiums don't equal cost. Cost lives in claims, administration, trend, and the friction between a visitor and a booked meeting.</p>
  <p>You can't stop claims. You can only measure them, price them, and route them through a system that does not blink.</p>
